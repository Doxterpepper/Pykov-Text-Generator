No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 

through doin' that shit.

You always say that, the same thing 

every time: never again, I'm through, 

too dangerous.

I know that's what I always say. I'm 

always right too, but

 but you forget about it in a day 

or two

 yeah, well, the days of me 

forgittin' are over, and the days of 

me rememberin' have just begun.

When you go on like this, you know 

what you sound like?

I sound like a sensible fucking man, 

is what I sound like.

You sound like a duck.

Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 

quack, quack...

Well take heart, 'cause you're never 

gonna hafta hear it again. Because 

since I'm never gonna do it again, 

you're never gonna hafta hear me 

quack about how I'm never gonna do 

it again.

After tonight.

Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

Oh yes, thank you.

I'm doin' fine.

I mean the way it is now, you're 

takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 

you rob a bank. You take more of a 

risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 

banks aren't supposed to stop you 

anyway, during a robbery. They're 

insured, why should they care? You 

don't even need a gun in a federal 

bank. I heard about this guy, walked 

into a federal bank with a portable 

phone, handed the phone to the teller, 

the guy on the other end of the phone 

said: "We got this guy's little girl, 

and if you don't give him all your 

money, we're gonna kill 'er."

Did it work?

Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 

talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 

a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 

not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 

cleans the place out, and they don't 

lift a fuckin' finger.

Did they hurt the little girl?

I don't know. There probably never 

was a little girl the point of the 

story isn't the little girl. The 

point of the story is they robbed 

the bank with a telephone.

You wanna rob banks?

I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 

I'm just illustrating that if we 

did, it would be easier than what we 

been doin'.

So you don't want to be a bank robber?

Naw, all those guys are goin' down 

the same road, either dead or servin' 

twenty.

And no more liquor stores?

What have we been talking about? 

Yeah, no moreliquor-stores. Besides, 

it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 

many foreigners own liquor stores. 

Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 

fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 

"Empty out the register," and they 

don't know what it fuckin' means. 

They make it too personal. We keep 

on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 

gonna make us kill 'em.

I'm not gonna kill anybody.

I don't wanna kill anybody either. 

But they'll probably put us in a 

situation where it's us of them. And 

if it's not the gooks, it these old 

Jews who've owned the store for 

fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 

Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 

counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 

walkin' into one of those stores 

with nothin' but a telephone, see 

how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 

it, we're out of it.

Well, what else is there, day jobs?

Not this life.

Well what then?

Garcon! Coffee!

This place.

"Garcon" means boy.

Here? It's a coffee shop.

What's wrong with that? People never 

rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 

stores, gas stations, you get your 

head blown off stickin' up one of 

them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 

you catch with their pants down. 

They're not expecting to get robbed, 

or not as expecting.

I bet in places like this you could 

cut down on the hero factor.

Correct. Just like banks, these places 

are insured. The managers don't give 

a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 

ya out the door before you start 

pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 

it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 

the register. Busboys, some wetback 

gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 

gonna really give a fuck you're 

stealin' from the owner. Customers 

are sittin' there with food in their 

mouths, they don't know what's goin' 

on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 

omelet, next minute somebody's 

stickin' a gun in their face.

See, I got the idea last liquor store 

we stuck up. 'Member all those 

customers kept comin' in?

Yeah.

Then you got the idea to take 

everybody's wallet.

Uhhuh.

That was a good idea.

Thanks.

We made more from the wallets then 

we did the register.

Yes we did.

A lot of people go to restaurants.

A lot of wallets.

Pretty smart, huh?

Pretty smart.

I'm ready, let's go, right here, 

right now.

Remember, same as before, you're 

crowd control, I handle the employees.

Got it.

I love you, Pumpkin.

I love you, Honey Bunny.

Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 

I'll execute every one of you 

motherfuckers!  Got that?

 Okay now, tell me about the hash 

bars?

What so you want to know?

Well, hash is legal there, right?

Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 

hundred percent legal. I mean you 

can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 

joint, and start puffin' away. You're 

only supposed to smoke in your home 

or certain designated places.

Those are hash bars?

Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 

legal to buy it, it's legal to own 

it and, if you're the proprietor of 

a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 

It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 

really matter 'cause get a load of 

this if the cops stop you, it's 

illegal for this to search you. 

Searching you is a right that the 

cops in Amsterdam don't have.

That did it, man I'm fuckin' goin', 

that's all there is to it.

You'll dig it the most. But you know 

what the funniest thing about Europe 

is?

What?

It's the little differences. A lotta 

the same shit we got here, they got 

there, but there they're a little 

different.

Examples?

Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 

in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 

in a paper cup either. They give you 

a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 

Paris, you can buy beer at 

MacDonald's. Also, you know what 

they call a Quarter Pounder with 

Cheese in Paris?

They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 

with Cheese?

No, they got the metric system there, 

they wouldn't know what the fuck a 

Quarter Pounder is.

What'd they call it?

Royale with Cheese.

Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 

a Big Mac?

Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 

it Le Big Mac.

Le Big Mac. What do they call a 

Whopper?

I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 

King.  But you know what they put on 

french fries in Holland instead of 

ketchup?

What?

Mayonnaise.

Goddamn!

I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 

little bit on the side of the plate, 

they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

Uuccch!

We should have shotguns for this 

kind of deal.

How many up there?

Three or four.

Counting our guy?

I'm not sure.

So there could be five guys up there?

It's possible.

We should have fuckin' shotguns.

What's her name?

Mia.

How did Marsellus and her meet?

I dunno, however people meet people. 

She usta be an actress.

She ever do anything I woulda saw?

I think her biggest deal was she 

starred in a pilot.

What's a pilot?

Well, you know the shows on TV?

I don't watch TV.

Yes, but you're aware that there's 

an invention called television, and 

on that invention they show shows?

Yeah.

Well, the way they pick the shows on 

TV is they make one show, and that 

show's called a pilot. And they show 

that one show to the people who pick 

the shows, and on the strength of 

that one show, they decide if they 

want to make more shows. Some get 

accepted and become TV programs, and 

some don't, and become nothing. She 

starred in one of the ones that became 

nothing.

You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half

black, halfSamoan, usta call him 

Tony Rocky Horror.

Yeah maybe, fat right?

I wouldn't go so far as to call the 

brother fat. He's got a weight 

problem.  What's the nigger gonna 

do, he's Samoan.

I think I know who you mean, what 

about him?

Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 

good.  And word around the campfire, 

it was on account of Marsellus 

Wallace's wife.

What'd he do, fuck her?

No no no no no no no, nothin' that 

bad.

Well what then?

He gave her a foot massage.

A foot massage?

That's all?

What did Marsellus do?

Sent a couple of guys over to his 

place.  They took him out on the 

patio of his apartment, threw his 

ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 

four stories. They had this garden 

at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 

like one of them greenhouses nigger 

fell through that. Since then, he's 

kinda developed a speech impediment.

That's a damn shame.

Still I hafta say, play with matches, 

ya get burned.

Whaddya mean?

You don't be givin' Marsellus 

Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

You don't think he overreacted?

Antwan probably didn't expect 

Marsellus to react like he did, but 

he had to expect a reaction.

It was a foot massage, a foot massage 

is nothing, I give my mother a foot 

massage.

It's laying hands on Marsellus 

Wallace's new wife in a familiar 

way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 

 no, but you're in the same fuckin' 

ballpark.

Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 

there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 

a bitch a foot massage ain't even 

the same fuckin' thing.

Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

It ain't no ballpark either. Look 

maybe your method of massage differs 

from mine, but touchin' his lady's 

feet, and stickin' your tongue in 

her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 

same ballpark, ain't the same league, 

ain't even the same fuckin' sport.

Foot massages don't mean shit.

Have you ever given a foot massage?

Don't be tellin' me about foot 

massages I'm the foot fuckin' 

master.

Given a lot of 'em?

Shit yeah. I got my technique down 

man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

Have you ever given a guy a foot 

massage?

Fuck you.

How many?

Fuck you.

Would you give me a foot massage 

I'm kinda tired.

Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 

pissed this is the door.

What time is it?

Seventwenty-two in the morning.

It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

Look, just because I wouldn't give 

no man a foot massage, don't make it 

right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 

off a building into a glass

motherfuckinhouse, fuckin' up the 

way the nigger talks. That ain't 

right, man. Motherfucker do that to 

me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 

I'd kill'a motherfucker.

I'm not sayin' he was right, but 

you're sayin' a foot massage don't 

mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 

I've given a million ladies a million 

foot massages and they all meant 

somethin'. We act like they don't, 

but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 

cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 

goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 

but you know it and she knows it, 

fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 

shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 

his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 

have a sense of humor about that 

shit.

That's an interesting point, but 

let's get into character.

What's her name again?

Mia. Why you so interested in big 

man's wife?

Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 

and when he's gone, he wants me to 

take care of Mia.

Take care of her?

Not that! Take her out. Show her a 

good time. Don't let her get lonely.

You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 

out on a date?

It ain't a date. It's like when you 

and your buddy's wife go to a movie 

or somethin'. It's just... you know... 

good company.

It's not a date.

Hey kids.

How you boys doin'?

Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 

a question.

We're doin' okay.

Do you know who we are?

We're associates of your business 

partner Marsellus Wallace, you 

remember your business partner 

dont'ya?

Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 

you're Brett, right?

I'm Brett.

I thought so. Well, you remember 

your business partner Marsellus 

Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

I remember him.

Good for you. Looks like me and 

Vincent caught you at breakfast, 

sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

Hamburgers.

Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 

nutritious breakfast. What kinda 

hamburgers?

Cheeseburgers.

No, I mean where did you get'em?

MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jackin-the-

Box, where?

Big Kahuna Burger.

Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 

Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 

got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 

had one myself, how are they?

They're good.

Mind if I try one of yours?

No.

Yours is this one, right?

Yeah.

Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.

Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 

Burger?

No.

You wanna bite, they're real good.

I ain't hungry.

Well, if you like hamburgers give 

'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 

usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 

a vegetarian. Which more or less 

makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 

love the taste of a good burger.

You know what they call a Quarter 

Pounder with Cheese in France?

No.

Tell 'em, Vincent.

Royale with Cheese.

Royale with Cheese, you know why 

they call it that?

Because of the metric system?

Check out the big brain on Brett. 

You'a smart motherfucker, that's 

right. The metric system.

What's in this?

Sprite.

Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 

your tasty beverage to wash this 

down with?

Sure.

Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!

You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 

what we're here for?

Then why don't you tell my boy here 

Vince, where you got the shit hid.

It's under the be

 I don't remember askin' you a 

goddamn thing.

You were sayin'?

It's under the bed.

Got it.

We happy?

Vincent!

We happy?

We're happy.

Look, what's your name? I got his 

name's Vincent, but what's yours?

My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 

your ass outta this shit.

I just want you to know how sorry we 

are about how fucked up things got 

between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 

entered into this thing, we only had 

the best intentions

Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 

concentration? I didn't mean to do 

that.  Please, continue. I believe 

you were saying something about "best 

intentions."

Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 

anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 

you describe for me what Marsellus 

Wallace looks like?

What country you from!

What?

"What" ain't no country I know! Do 

they speak English in "What?"

What?

Englishmotherfucker-can-you-speak-

it?

Yes.

Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

Yes.

Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 

looks like!

What?

Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 

again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 

motherfucker, say "What" one more 

goddamn time!

Now describe to me what Marsellus 

Wallace looks like!

Well he's... he's... black

 go on!

...and he's... he's... bald

 does he look like a bitch?!

What?

Doeshe-look-like-a-bitch?!

No.

Then why did you try to fuck 'im 

like a bitch?!

I didn't.

Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 

'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

Yes.

There's a passage I got memorized, 

seems appropriate for this situation: 

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

righteous man is beset on all sides 

by the inequities of the selfish and 

the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 

he who, in the name of charity and 

good will, shepherds the weak through 

the valley of darkness, for he is 

truly his brother's keeper and the 

finder of lost children. And I will 

strike down upon thee with great 

vengeance and furious anger those 

who attempt to poison and destroy my 

brothers. And you will know my name 

is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 

upon you."

I think you're gonna find when all 

this shit is over and done I think 

you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 

motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 

now you got ability. But painful as 

it may be, ability don't last. Now 

that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 

life, but it's a fact of life your 

ass is gonna hafta git realistic 

about. This business is filled to 

the brim with unrealistic 

motherfuckers who thought their ass 

aged like wine.  Besides, even if 

you went all the way, what would you 

be? Featherweight champion of the 

world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 

can even get a credit card based on 

that.

Now the night of the fight, you may 

fell a slight sting, that's pride 

fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 

only hurts, it never helps. Fight 

through that shit. 'Cause a year 

from now, when you're kickin' it in 

the Caribbean you're gonna say, 

"Marsellus Wallace was right."

I got no problem with that.

In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Say it!

In the fifth, my ass goes down.

Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 

git your ass on in here.

Where's the big man?

He's over there, finishing up some 

business.

Hang back for a second or two, and 

when you see the white boy leave, go 

on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 

make you an espresso?

How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 

American?

Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 

out tomorrow?

At Marsellus' request.

Have you met Mia?

Not yet.

What's so funny?

Not a goddamn thing.

Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 

man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 

across a table, chew my food with my 

mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 

that's all I'm gonna do.

My name's Paul, and this is between 

y'all.

Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

Filters?

Non.

Lookin' at somethin', friend?

I ain't your friend, palooka.

What was that?

I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Vincent Vega has entered the building, 

git your ass over here!

Pack of Red Apples, dollarforty.

...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 

book on body piercing.

You know how they use that gun when 

they pierce your ears? They don't 

use that when they pierce your 

nipples, do they?

Forget that gun. That gun goes against 

the entire idea behind piercing. All 

of my piercing, sixteen places on my 

body, every one of 'em done with a 

needle. Five in each ear. One through 

the nipple on my left breast. One 

through my right nostril.  One through 

my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 

One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 

my tongue.

Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 

curious, why would you get a stud in 

your tongue?

It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

Vince, you can come in now!

Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 

good stuff. This is Bava, different, 

but equally good. And this is Choco 

from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 

Now the first two are the same, forty

five an ounce those are friend 

prices but this one...

...this one's a little more expensive.  

It's fiftyfive. But when you shoot 

it, you'll know where that extra 

money went.  Nothing wrong with the 

first two. It's real, real, real, 

good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 

madman.

Remember, I just got back from 

Amsterdam.

Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? 

No.  You're in my house. White people 

who know the difference between good 

shit and bad shit, this is the house 

they come to. My shit, I'll take the 

Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit 

any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

That's a bold statement.

This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is 

a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' 

dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back 

in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole 

seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, 

they're as hot as hell.

Give me three hundred worth of the 

madman.  If it's as good as you say, 

I'll be back for a thousand.

I just hope I still have it. Whaddya 

think of Trudi? She ain't got a 

boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get 

high?

Which one's Trudi? The one with all 

the shit in her face?

No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

I'm on my way somewhere. I got a 

dinner engagement. Rain check?

No problem?

You don't mind if I shoot up here?

Me casa, su casa.

Mucho gracias.

Still got your Malibu?

You know what some fucker did to it 

the other day?

What?

Fuckin' keyed it.

Oh man, that's fucked up.

Tell me about it. I had the goddamn 

thing in storage three years. It's 

out five fuckin' days five days, 

and some dickless piece of shit fucks 

with it.

They should be fuckin' killed. No 

trial, no jury, straight to execution.

I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, 

ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything 

to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been 

worth his doin' it, if I coulda just 

caught 'em, you know what I mean?

It's chicken shit. You don't fuck 

another man's vehicle.

Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. 

The door's open. Come inside and 

make yourself a drink.

Hello?

Vincent.

Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

It's on the wall by the two African 

fellas.

To your right.

...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Hello.

Push the button if you want to talk.

Hello.

Go make yourself a drink., and I'll 

be down in two shakes of a lamb's 

tail.

The bar's by the fireplace.

Okay.

Let's go.

What the fuck is this place?

This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 

man should love it.

Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

You can get a steak here, daddyo. 

Don't be a...

After you, kittycat.

Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 

or bloody as hell?

Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 

vanilla coke.

How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger 

bloody and a fivedollar shake.

How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 

Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

Martin and Lewis.

Did you just order a fivedollar 

shake?

Sure did.

A shake? Milk and ice cream?

Uhhuh.

It costs five dollars?

Yep.

You don't put bourbon in it or 

anything?

Nope.

Just checking.

Whaddya think?

It's like a wax museum with a pulse 

rate.

What are you doing?

Rollin' a smoke.

Here?

It's just tobacco.

Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 

me one, cowboy?

You can have this one, cowgirl.

Thanks.

Think nothing of it.

Marsellus said you just got back 

from Amsterdam.

Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

That was my fifteen minutes.

What was it?

It was show about a team of female 

secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

What?

"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 

bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 

we're a force to be reckoned with. 

Five, as in there's one... two ... 

three... four... five of us. There 

was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 

from that show "Baton Rouge," she 

was the leader. A Japanese one, a 

black one, a French one and a brunette 

one, me.  We all had special skills. 

Sommerset had a photographic memory, 

the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 

the black girl was a demolition 

expert, the French fox' specialty 

was sex...

What was your specialty?

Knives. The character I played, Raven 

McCoy, her background was she was 

raised by circus performers. So she 

grew up doing a knife act. According 

to the show, she was the deadliest 

woman in the world with a knife. But 

because she grew up in a circus, she 

was also something of an acrobat. 

She could do illusions, she was a 

trapeze artist when you're keeping 

the world safe from evil, you never 

know when being a trapeze artist's 

gonna come in handy. And she knew a 

zillion old jokes her grandfather, 

an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 

we woulda got picked up, they woulda 

worked in a gimmick where every 

episode I woulda told and ol joke.

Do you remember any of the jokes?

Well I only got the chance to say 

one, 'cause we only did one show.

Tell me.

No. It's really corny.

C'mon, don't be that way.

No. You won't like it and I'll be 

embarrassed.

You told it in front of fifty million 

people and you can't tell it to me? 

I promise I won't laugh.

That's what I'm afraid of.

That's not what I meant and you know 

it.

You're quite the silver tongue devil, 

aren't you?

I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

That's not what you said Vince. Well 

now I'm definitely not gonna tell 

ya, 'cause it's been built up too 

much.

What a gyp.

Yummy!

Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 

to know what a fivedollar shake 

tastes like.

Be my guest.

You can use my straw, I don't have 

kooties.

Yeah, but maybe I do.

Kooties I can handle.

Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 

good milk shake.

Told ya.

I don't know if it's worth five 

dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 

good.

Don't you hate that?

What?

Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 

feel it's necessary to yak about 

bullshit in order to be comfortable?

I don't know.

That's when you know you found 

somebody special. When you can just 

shit the fuck up for a minute, and 

comfortably share silence.

I don't think we're there yet. But 

don't feel bad, we just met each 

other.

Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 

the bathroom and powder my nose, 

while you sit here and think of 

something to say.

I'll do that.

I said goddamn!

Don't you love it when you go to the 

bathroom and you come back to find 

your food waiting for you?

We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 

Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 

waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 

Monroe's section.

Which one, there's two Marilyn 

Monroes.

No there's not.

That's Marilyn Monroe...

... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 

don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 

must be her night off.

Pretty smart.

I have moments.

Did ya think of something to say?

Actually, there's something I've 

wanted to ask you about, but you 

seem like a nice person, and I didn't 

want to offend you.

Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 

mindless, boring, gettingto-know-

you chitchat. This sounds like you 

actually have something to say.

Only if you promise not to get 

offended.

You can't promise something like 

that. I have no idea what you're 

gonna ask. You could ask me what 

you're gonna ask me, and my natural 

response could be to be offended. 

Then, through no fault of my own, I 

woulda broken my promise.

Then let's just forget it.

That is an impossibility. Trying to 

forget anything as intriguing as 

this would be an exercise in futility.

Is that a fact?

Besides, it's more exciting when you 

don't have permission.

What do you think about what happened 

to Antwan?

Who's Antwan?

Tony Rocky Horror.

He fell out of a window.

That's one way to say it. Another 

way is, he was thrown out. Another 

was is, he was thrown out by 

Marsellus. And even another way is, 

he was thrown out of a window by 

Marsellus because of you.

Is that a fact?

No it's not, it's just what I heard.

Who told you this?

They.

They talk a lot, don't they?

They certainly do.

Well don't by shy Vincent, what 

exactly did they say?

Let me help you Bashful, did it 

involve the Fword?

No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 

you a foot massage.

And...?

No and, that's it.

You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 

out of a fourstory window because 

he massaged my feet?

Yeah.

And you believed that?

At the time I was told, it seemed 

reasonable.

Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 

four story window for giving me a 

foot massage seemed reasonable?

No, it seemed excessive. But that 

doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 

heard Marsellus is very protective 

of you.

A husband being protective of his 

wife is one thing. A husband almost 

killing another man for touching his 

wife's feet is something else.

But did it happen?

The only thing Antwan ever touched 

of mine was my hand, when he shook 

it. I met Anwan once at my wedding 

 then never again.  The truth is, 

nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 

Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 

except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 

Horror. But when you scamps get 

together, you're worse than a sewing 

circle.

Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment 

you've all been waiting for, the 

worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist 

contest.

...One lucky couple will win this 

handsome trophy that Marilyn here is 

holding.

...Now, who will be our first 

contestants?

Right here.

I wanna dance.

No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 

believe Marsellus, my husband, your 

boss, told you to take me out and do 

whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 

dance. I want to win. I want that 

trophy.

All right.

So, dance good.

All right, you asked for it.

Let's hear it for our first 

contestants.

Now let's meet our first contestants 

here this evening. Young lady, what 

is your name?

Missus Mia Wallace.

And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

Vincent Vega.

All right, let's see what you can 

do. Take it away!

Was than an uncomfortable silence?

I don't know what that was.

Music and drinks!

I'm gonna take a piss.

That was a little bit more information 

than I needed to know, but go right 

ahead.

Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 

you've been holding out on me.

One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 

but drink your drink quickly, say 

goodbye, walk out the door, get in 

your car, and go down the road.

...It's a moral test of yourself, 

whether or not you can maintain 

loyalty. Because when people are 

loyal to each other, that's very 

meaningful.

So you're gonna go out there, drink 

your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 

a very lovely evening," go home, and 

jack off.  And that's all you're 

gonna do.

Jesus Christ!

Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

I'll be a sonof-a-bitch.

Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 

me honey, what did you take?

Okay honey, we're getting you on 

your feet.

We're on our feet now, and now we're 

gonna talk out to the car. Here we 

go, watch us walk.

Hold hands, you love birds.

Lance! The phone's ringing!

I can hear it!

I thought you told those fuckin' 

assholes never to call this late!

I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna 

tell this fuckin' asshole right now!

Hello, do you know how late it is? 

You're not supposed to be callin' me 

this fuckin' late.

Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big 

fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way 

to your place.

Whoa, hold you horses man, what's 

the problem?

You still got an adrenaline shot?

Maybe.

I need it man, I got a chick she's 

fuckin'  Doing on me.

Don't bring her here!  I'm not even 

fuckin' joking with you, don't you 

be bringing some fucked up poohbutt 

to my house!

No choice.

She's ODin'?

Yeah. She's dyin'.

Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 

'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

Negative.

She ain't my fuckin' problem, you 

fucked her up, you deal with it 

are you talkin' to me on a cellular 

phone?

Sorry.

I don't know you, who is this, don't 

come here, I'm hangin' up.

Too late, I'm already here.

What the hell was that?

Have you lost your mind?! You crashed 

your car in my fuckin' house! You 

talk about drug shit on a cellular 

fuckin' phone

If you're through havin' your little 

hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get 

your needle and git it now!

Are you deaf? You're not bringin' 

that fucked up bitch in my house!

This fucked up bitch is Marsellus 

Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' 

croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But 

before he turns me into a bar soap, 

I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about 

how you coulda saved her life, but 

instead you let her die on your front 

lawn.

It's only onethirty in the goddamn 

mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 

out here?

Who's she?

Get that black box in the bedroom I 

have with the adrenaline shot.

What's wrong with her?

She's ODing on us.

Well get her the hell outta here!

Get the fuckin' shot!

Don't yell and me!

You two are a match made in heaven.

Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?

While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta 

get a medical book.

What do you need a medical book for?

To tell me how to do it. I've never 

given an adrenaline shot before.

You've had that thing for six years 

and you never used it?

I never had to use it. I don't go 

joypoppin' with bubblegummers, all 

of my friends can handle their highs!

Well then get it.

I am, if you'll let me.

I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' 

to her.

Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

I'm looking as fast as I can!

What's he lookin' for?

I dunno, some medical book.

What are you lookin' for?

My black medical book!

Whata're you looking for?

My black fuckin' medical book. It's 

like a text book they give to nurses.

I never saw a medical book.

Trust me, I have one.

Well if it's that important, why 

didn't you keep it with the shot?

I don't know! Stop bothering me!

While you're lookin' for it, that 

girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 

never gonna find it in all this shit.  

For six months now, I've been telling 

you to clean this room

 get your ass in here, fuck the 

book!

Quit fuckin' around man and give her 

the shot!

While I'm doing this, take her shirt 

off and find her heart.

Does it have to be exact?

Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 

her an injection in the heart, so I 

gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

Well, I don't know exactly where her 

heart is, I think it's here.

That's it.

I need a big fat magic marker, got 

one?

What?

I need a big fat magic marker, any 

felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 

would be great.

Hold on.

It's ready, I'll tell you what to 

do.

You're gonna give her the shot.

No, you're gonna give her the shot.

I've never does this before.

I've never done this before either, 

and I ain't starting now. You brought 

'er here, that means you give her 

the shot. The day I bring an ODing 

bitch to your place, then I gotta 

give her the shot.

Got it.

Okay, what do I do?

Well, you're giving her an injection 

of adrenaline straight to her heart. 

But she's got a breast plate in front 

of her heart, so you gotta pierce 

through that. So what you gotta do 

is bring the needle down in a stabbing 

motion.

I gotta stab her?

If you want the needle to pierce 

through to her heart, you gotta stab 

her hard.

What happens after that?

I'm curious about that myself.

This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

She's supposed to come out of it 

like

 that.

Count to three.

One...

...two...

...three!

If you're okay, say something.

Something.

Anybody want a beer?

Mia!

What are your thoughts on how to 

handle this?

What's yours?

Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 

can live his whole live and never 

ever hear of this incident.

Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 

ever heard of this, I'd be in as 

much trouble as you.

I seriously doubt that.

If you can keep a secret, so can I.

Let's shake on it.

Mum's the word.

If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 

and have a heart attack.

You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 

FIVE" joke?

Sure, but I think I'm still a little 

too petrified to laugh.

Uhhuh. You won't laugh because it's 

not funny. But if you still wanna 

hear it, I'll tell it.

I can't wait.

Three tomatoes are walking down the 

street, a poppa tomato, a momma 

tomato, and a little baby tomato. 

The baby tomato is lagging behind 

the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 

tomato gets mad, goes over to the 

momma tomato and stamps on him

 and says: catch up.

See ya 'round, Vince.

Butch.

Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 

got a special visitor. Now do you 

remember when I told you your daddy 

dies in a P.O.W. camp?

Uhhuh.

Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 

was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 

a bunch about you. See, I was a good 

friend of your Daddy's. We were in 

that Hanoi pit of hell over five 

years together.  Hopefully, you'll 

never have to experience this 

yourself, but when two men are in a 

situation like me and your Daddy 

were, for as long as we were, you 

take on certain responsibilities of 

the other. If it had been me who had 

not made it, Major Coolidge would be 

talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 

the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 

to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 

ya.

This watch I got here was first 

purchased by your greatgranddaddy. 

It was bought during the First World 

War in a little general store in 

Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 

by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 

the day he set sail for Paris. It 

was your greatgranddaddy's war watch, 

made by the first company to ever 

make wrist watches. You see, up until 

then, people just carried pocket 

watches. Your greatgranddaddy wore 

that watch every day he was in the 

war. Then when he had done his duty, 

he went home to your great

grandmother, took the watch off his 

wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 

can. And in that can it stayed 'til 

your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 

called upon by his country to go 

overseas and fight the Germans once 

again. This time they called it World 

War Two. Your greatgranddaddy gave 

it to your granddad for good luck.  

Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 

good as his old man's. Your granddad 

was a Marine and he was killed with 

all the other Marines at the battle 

of Wake Island. Your granddad was 

facing death and he knew it. None of 

those boys had any illusions about 

ever leavin' that island alive. So 

three days before the Japanese took 

the island, your 22year old 

grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 

Force transport named Winocki, a man 

he had never met before in his life, 

to deliver to his infant son, who he 

had never seen in the flesh, his 

gold watch. Three days later, your 

grandfather was dead. But Winocki 

kept his word. After the war was 

over, he paid a visit to your 

grandmother, delivering to your infant 

father, his Dad's gold watch. This 

watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 

wrist when he was shot down over 

Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 

Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 

if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 

be confiscated. The way your Daddy 

looked at it, that watch was your 

birthright. And he'd be damned if 

and slopeheads were gonna put their 

greasy yella hands on his boy's 

birthright. So he hid it in the one 

place he knew he could hide somethin'. 

His ass. Five long years, he wore 

this watch up his ass. Then when he 

died of dysentery, he gave me the 

watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 

of metal up my ass for two years. 

Then, after seven years, I was sent 

home to my family. And now, little 

man, I give the watch to you.

It's time, Butch.

I'm ready.

 Well Dan, that had to be the 

bloodiest and, handsdown, the most 

brutal fight this city has ever seen.

...Coolidge was out of there faster 

than I've ever seen a victorious 

boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 

he knew Willis was dead?

My guess would be yes, Richard. I 

could see from my position here, the 

frenzy in his eyes give way to the 

realization of what he was doing. I 

think any man would've left the ring 

that fast.

Do you feel this ring death tragedy 

will have an effect on the world of 

boxing?

Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 

help but shake the world of boxing 

to its very foundation. But it's of 

paramount importance that during the 

sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the 

W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the

Are you the man I was supposed to 

pick up?

If you're the cab I called, I'm the 

guy you're supposed to pick up.

Where to?

Outta here.

Mia. How you doin'?

Great. I never thanked you for the 

dinner.

What'cha got?

He booked.

I'm prepared to scour the earth for 

this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 

Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 

in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 

cap in his ass.

I'll take care of it.

Hey, how do I open the window back 

here?

I have to do it.

Hey, mister?

What?

You were in that fight? The fight on 

the radio you're the fighter?

Whatever gave you that idea?

No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 

him, tell me you're him.

I'm him.

You killed the other boxing man.

He's dead?

The radio said he was dead.

Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

What does it feel like?

What does what feel like?

Killing a man. Beating another man 

to death with your bare hands.

Are you some kinda weirdo?

No, it's a subject I have much 

interest in. You are the first person 

I ever met who has killed somebody. 

So, what was it like to kill a man?

Tell ya what, you give me one of 

them cigarettes, I'll give you an 

answer.

Deal!

So...

...Esmarelda Villalobos is that 

Mexican?

The name is Spanish, but I'm 

Columbian.

It's a very pretty name.

It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

That's one hell of a name you got 

there, sister.

Thank you. And what is your name?

Butch.

Butch. What does it mean?

I'm an American, our names don't 

mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 

what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

I want to know what it feels like to 

kill a man

 I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 

he was dead 'til you told me he was 

dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 

wanna know how I feel about it?

I don't feel the least little bit 

bad.

What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 

got out a fix was in, the odds would 

be outta control. Hey, if he was a 

better fighter he's be alive. If he 

never laced up his gloves in the 

first place, which he never shoulda 

done, he'd be alive. Enough about 

the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 

talk about the rich and prosperous 

Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 

spread it around with?

Eight? How long to collect?

So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 

it all?

Good news Scotty, real good news I 

understand a few stragglers aside. 

Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 

the morning. It should take us a 

couple days to get into Knoxville. 

Next time we see each other, it'll 

be on Tennessee time.

Fabienne my love, our adventure 

begins.

Fortyfive sixty.

Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 

something for the effort.

Now if anybody should ask you about 

who your fare was tonight, what're 

you gonna tell 'em?

The truth. Three welldressed, 

slightly toasted, Mexicans.

Bon soir, Esmarelda.

Sleep well, Butch.

Keep the light off.

Is that better, sugar pop?

Oui. Hard day at the office?

Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

I was looking at myself in the mirror.

Uhhuh?

I wish I had a pot.

You were lookin' in the mirror and 

you wish you had some pot?

A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 

sexy.

Well you should be happy, 'cause you 

do.

Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 

I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 

when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 

the same thing.

I didn't realize there was a 

difference between a tummy and a pot 

belly.

The difference is huge.

You want me to have a pot?

No. Pot bellies make a man look either 

oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 

woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 

rest of you is normal. Normal face, 

normal legs, normal hips, normal 

ass, but with a big, perfectly round 

pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 

teeshirt two sizes too small to 

accentuate it.

You think guys would find that 

attractive?

I don't give a damn what men find 

attractive. It's unfortunate what we 

find pleasing to the touch and 

pleasing to the eye is seldom the 

same.

If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 

it.

You'd punch me in my belly?

Right in the belly.

I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 

right on your face 'til you couldn't 

breathe.

You'd do that to me?

Yes!

Did you get everything, sugar pop?

Yes, I did.

Good job.

Did everything go as planned?

You didn't listen to the radio?

I never listen to your fights. Were 

you the winner?

I won alright.

Are you still retiring?

Sure am.

What about the man you fought?

Floyd retired too.

Really?! He won't be fighting no 

more?!

Not no more.

So it all worked out in the finish?

We ain't at the finish, baby.

We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

If they find us, they'll kill us, 

won't they?

But they won't find us, will they?

Do you still want me to go with you?

I don't want to be a burden or a 

nuisance

Say it!

Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

Forever?

...and ever.

Do you love me?

Oui.

Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Will you kiss it?

But you first.

Butch my love, the adventure begins.

I think I cracked a rib.

Giving me oral pleasure?

No retard, from the fight.

Don't call me retard.

My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

Shut up fuck head! I hate that 

Mongoloid voice.

Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 

back!  Can I have a towel please, 

Miss Beautiful Tulip.

Oh I like that, I like being called 

a tulip. Tulip is much better than 

Mongoloid.

I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 

called you a retard, but I took it 

back.

Merci beaucoup.

Butch?

Yes, lemon pie.

Where are we going to go?

I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 

We're gonna get a lot of money from 

this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 

we can live like hogs in the fat 

house forever. I was thinking we 

could go somewhere in the South 

Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 

carry us a long way down there.

So if we wanted, we could live in 

Bora Bora?

You betcha. And if after awhile you 

don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 

move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

But I do not speak Spanish.

You don't speak Bora Boran either.

Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 

el zapataria?

What does that mean?

Where's the shoe store?

Donde esta el zapataria?

Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 

my little mama ceta in no time.

Que hora es?

Que hora es?

What time is it?

What time is it?

Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Butch.

Forget it.

Merde! You startled me. Did you have 

a bad dream?

What are you watching?

A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 

name.

Are you watchin' it?

In a way. Why? Would you like for me 

to switch it off?

Would you please?

It's a little too early in the morning 

for explosions and war.

What was it about?

How should I know, you were the one 

watchin' it.

No, imbecile, what was your dream 

about?

Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 

rare I remember a dream.

You just woke up from it.

Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 

don't remember.

Well, let's look at the grumpy man 

in the morning. I didn't say you 

were lying, it's just odd you don't 

remember your dreams. I always 

remember mine. Did you know you talk 

in your sleep?

I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 

in my sleep?

You did last night.

What did I say?

I don't know. I couldn't understand 

you.

Why don't you get up and we'll get 

some breakfast at that breakfast 

place with the pancakes.

One more kiss and I'll get up.

Satisfied?

Yep.

Then get up, lazy bones.

What time is it?

Almost nine in the morning. What 

time does our train arrive?

Eleven.

I'm gonna order a big plate of 

blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 

eggs over easy, and five sausages.

Anything to drink with that?

Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 

tall glass or orange juice and a 

black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 

going to have a slice of pie.

Pie for breakfast?

Any time of the day is a good time 

for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 

the pancakes. And on top, a thin 

slice of melted cheese

 where's my watch?

It's there.

No, it's not. It's not here.

Have you looked?

Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 

Are you sure you got it?

Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 



 on the little kangaroo.

Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

Well it's not here!

Well it should be!

Oh it most definitely should be here, 

but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 

watch. You know what my father went 

through to git me that watch?... I 

don't wanna get into it right now... 

but he went through a lot. Now all 

this other shit, you coulda set on 

fire, but I specifically reminded 

you not to forget my father's watch. 

Now think, did you get it?

I believe so...

You believe so? You either did, or 

you didn't, now which one is it?

Then I did.

Are you sure?

No.

No! It's not your fault.

You left it at the apartment.

If you did leave it at the apartment, 

it's not your fault. I had you bring 

a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 

about it, but I didn't illustrate 

how personal the watch was to me. If 

all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 

I should've told you. You ain't a 

mind reader.

I'm sorry.

Don't be. It just means I won't be 

able to eat breakfast with you.

Why does it mean that?

Because I'm going back to my apartment 

to get my watch.

Won't the gangsters be looking for 

you there?

That's what I'm gonna find out. If 

they are, and I don't think I can 

handle it, I'll split.

I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 

I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 

you could ever do would make me 

permanently angry at you.

I love you, remember?

Now here's some money, order those 

pancakes and have a great breakfast.

Don't go.

I'll be back before you can say, 

blueberry pie.

Blueberry pie.

Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 

Okay?  Okay?

Okay.

Byebye, sugar pop.

Bye.

I'm gonna take your Honda.

Okay.

Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 

forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 

I specifically reminded her not to 

forget it. "Bedside table on the 

kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 

forget my father's watch."

Holy shit.

That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 

Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 

ya.

Jesus, are you okay?

I guess.

He's dead! He's dead!

If you need a witness in court, I'll 

be glad to help. He was a drunken 

maniac. He hit you and crashed into 

that car.

Who?

Him.

Well, I'll be damned.

Sacre bleu.

Oh my God, I've been shot!

Can I help you wit' somethin'?

Shut up!

Now you just wait one goddamn minute 



So you like chasing people, huh?

Well guess what, big man, you caught 

me

 hold it right there, godammit!

Look mister, this ain't any of your 

business

 I'm makin' it my business! Now 

toss that gun!

Now you on top, stand up and come to 

the counter.

Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 

caught a coupl'a flies.

Nobody kills anybody in my place of 

business except me or Zed.

That's Zed.

You said you waited for me?

I did.

Then how come they're all beat up?

They did that to each other. They 

was fightin' when they came in. This 

one was gonna shoot that one.

You were gonna shoot him?

Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 

of this place?

Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

No, it's Thursday.

Then she'll be fine.

Bring out The Gimp.

I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 

up then, won't you?

Wake up!

Down!

Who's first?

I ain't fer sure yet.

Wanna do it here?

Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 

room.

Up!

Keep an eye on this one.

Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 

in 'em!

You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 

Good, I like to fight!

That's it... that's it boy, you're 

goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 

that... that's good.

Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 

Zed goddammit, git over here and 

hold 'em!

Huhng?

Hey hillbilly.

You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Step aside, Butch.

You okay?

Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 

okay!

What now?

What now? Well let me tell you what 

now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe

hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 

on homes here with a pair of pliers 

and a blow torch.

Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 

ain't through with you by a damn 

sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 

your ass.

I meant what now, between me and 

you?

Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 

ya what now between me an' you. There 

is no me an' you. Not no more.

So we're cool?

Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 

ask two things I ask: Don't tell 

nobody about this. This shit's between 

me and you and the soonto-be-livin'-

therest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-

agonizingpain, Mr. Rapist here. It 

ain't nobody else's business. Two: 

leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 

when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 

lost your Los Angeles privileges.  

Deal?

Deal.

Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 

bit of a situation.

Butch, I was so worried!

Honey, grab your radio and your purse 

and let's go!

But what about all our bags?

Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 

if we don't split now.

Is everything well? Are we in danger?

We're cool. In fact, we're super

cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 

for you outside.

Where did you get this motorcycle?

It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

What happened to my Honda?

Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

You're hurt?

I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 

Hop on.

Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

I'm sorry, babylove.

You were gone so long, I started to 

think dreadful thoughts.

I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.

Everything's fine. Hey, how was 

breakfast?

It was good

 did you get the blueberry pancakes?

No, they didn't have blueberry 

pancakes, I had to get buttermilk 

are you sure you're okay?

Babylove, from the moment I left 

you, this has been without a doubt 

the single weirdest day of my entire 

life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 

it.

Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

It's a chopper.

Whose chopper is this?

Zed's.

Who's Zed?

Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

You ever read the Bible, Brett?

Yes!

There's a passage I got memorized, 

seems appropriate for this situation: 

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

righteous man is beset on all sides 

by the inequities of the selfish and 

the tyranny of evil men..."

"...blessed is he who, in the name 

of charity and good will, shepherded 

the weak through the valley of 

darkness. And I will strike down 

upon thee with great vengeance and 

furious anger those who attempt to 

poison and destroy my brothers. And 

you will know I am the Lord when I 

lay my vengeance upon you."

Friend of yours?

Yeah, MarvinVincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Die... die... die... die...!

I don't understand

Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 

that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 

mind?  Forget he was in there with a 

goddamn hand cannon?

We should be fuckin' dead right now.

Did you see that gun he fired at us? 

It was bigger than him.

.357.

We should be fuckin' dead!

Yeah, we were lucky.

That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 

somethin' else.

Yeah, maybe.

That was... divine intervention. You 

know what divine intervention is?

Yeah, I think so. That means God 

came down from Heaven and stopped 

the bullets.

Yeah, man, that's what is means. 

That's exactly what it means! God 

came down from Heaven and stopped 

the bullets.

I think we should be going now.

Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 

that!  Don't blow this shit off! 

What just happened was a fuckin' 

miracle!

Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 

happens.

Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 

happen.

Do you wanna continue this theological 

discussion in the car, or at the 

jailhouse with the cops?

We should be fuckin' dead now, my 

friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 

and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 

it!

Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 

leave now?

...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 

was watchin' it once and this cop 

was on it who was talkin' about this 

time he got into this gun fight with 

a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 

this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 

And these guys were in a hallway. 

It's a freak, but it happens.

If you wanna play blind man, then go 

walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 

eyes are wide fuckin' open.

What the fuck does that mean?

That's it for me. For here on in, 

you can consider my ass retired.

Jesus Christ!

Don't blaspheme!

Goddammit, Jules

 I said don't do that

 you're fuckin' freakin' out!

I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 

through.

While you're at it, be sure to tell 

'im why.

Don't worry, I will.

I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 

laughs his ass off.

I don't give a damn if he does.

Marvin, what do you make of all this?

I don't even have an opinion.

C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 

down from Heaven and stopped the 

bullets?

What the fuck's happening?

I just accidentally shot Marvin in 

the throat.

Why the fuck did you do that?

I didn't mean to do it. I said it 

was an accident.

I've seen a lot of crazyass shit in 

my time

 chill out, man, it was an accident, 

okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 

and the gun went off.

The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 

bump!

Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 

sonofa-bitch, the gun just went 

off, don't ask me how!

Look at this mess! We're drivin' 

around on a city street in broad 

daylight

 I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 

about the splatter.

Well you better be thinkin' about it 

now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 

car off the road. Cops tend to notice 

shit like you're driving a car 

drenched in fuckin' blood.

Can't we just take it to a friendly 

place?

This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 

don't got no friendly places in the 

Valley.

Well, don't look at me, this is your 

town, Jules.

Who ya callin'?

A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

Where's Toluca Lake.

On the other side of the hill, by 

Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 

ain't home, I don't know what the 

fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 

other partners in 818.

Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.

Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 

in some serious shit. We're in a car 

we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 

need to use your garage for a couple 

hours.

We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 

with this Jimmie's situation. He's 

one remark away from kickin' our 

asses out the door.

If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 

a couple phone calls. But I never 

want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 

my friend and you don't bust in your 

friend's house and start tellin' 'im 

what's what.

Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 

kinda freaked out back there when he 

saw Marvin.

Put yourself in his position. It's 

eight o'clock in the morning. He 

just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 

this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 

who a favor.

If the price of that favor is I gotta 

take shit, he can stick his favor 

straight up his ass.

What the fuck did you just do to his 

towel?

I was just dryin' my hands.

You're supposed to wash 'em first.

You watched me wash 'em.

I watched you get 'em wet.

I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 

get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 

I coulda done a better job.

I used the same soap you did and 

when I dried my hands, the towel 

didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 

pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 

cares? But it's shit like this that's 

gonna bring this situation to a boil. 

If he were to come in here and see 

that towel like that... I'm tellin' 

you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 

if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 

on account of you... Look, I ain't 

threatenin' you, I respect you an' 

all, just don't put me in that 

position.

Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 

problem. He's your friend, you handle 

him.

Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 

gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 

been satisfied with freezedried 

Tasters Choice. You spring this 

gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 

flavor is this?

Knock it off, Julie.

What?

I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 

stop butterin' me up. I don't need 

you to tell me how good my coffee 

is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 

how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 

goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 

the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 

when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 

But what's on my mind at this moment 

isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 

the dead nigger in my garage.

Jimmie

 I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 

question, Jules. When you drove in 

here, did you notice a sign out front 

that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

 answer to question. Did you see a 

sign out in front of my house that 

said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Naw man, I didn't.

You know why you didn't see that 

sign?

Why?

'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 

fuckin' business!

 I ain't through! Now don't you 

understand that if Bonnie comes home 

and finds a dead body in her house, 

I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 

counselor, no trial separation 

fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 

get fuckin' divorced. The last time 

me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 

was gonna be the last time me an' 

Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 

wanna help ya out Julie, I really 

do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 

doin' it.

Jimmie

 don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 

can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 

you can say that's gonna make me 

forget I love my wife. Now she's 

workin' the graveyard shift at the 

hospital. She'll be comin' home in 

less than an hour and a half. Make 

your phone calls, talk to your people, 

than get the fuck out of my house.

That's all we want. We don't wanna 

fuck up your shit. We just need to 

call our people to bring us in.

Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 

in my bedroom.

...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 

think she'll do?

No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 

ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 

I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

You got to appreciate what an 

explosive element this Bonnie 

situation is. If she comes home from 

a hard day's work and finds a bunch 

of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 

shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 

what she's apt to do.

I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 

doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

I don't wanna hear about no 

motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 

hear from your ass is: "you ain't 

got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 

motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 

them niggers out and wait for the 

cavalry, which should be comin' 

directly."

You ain't got no problems, Jules. 

I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 

there, chill them niggers out and 

wait for The Wolf, who should be 

comin' directly.

You sendin' The Wolf?

Feel better?

Shit Negro, that's all you had to 

say.

Is she the hysterical type?

When she due?

Give me the principals' names again?

Jules...

...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

Expect a call around 10:30. It's 

about thirty minutes away. I'll be 

there in ten.

You're Jimmie, right? This is your 

house?

Yeah.

I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

Good, 'cause we got one.

So I heard. May I come in?

Please do.

You must be Jules, which would make 

you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 

tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 

correctly, the clock is ticking, is 

that right, Jimmie?

100%.

Your wife, Bonnie...

...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 

that correct?

Uhhuh.

I was led to believe if she comes 

home and finds us here, she wouldn't 

appreciate it none too much.

She won't at that.

That gives us forty minutes to get 

the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 

do what I say when I say it, should 

by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 

car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 

me to it.

Jimmie?

Yes.

Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 

smelled some coffee in there. Would 

you make me a cup?

Sure, how do you take it?

Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

About the car, is there anything I 

need to know? Does it stall, does it 

make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 

is there gas in it, anything?

Aside from how it looks, the car's 

cool.

Positive?  Don't get me out on the 

road and I find out the brake lights 

don't work.

Hey man, as far as I know, the 

motherfucker's tiptop.

Good enough, let's go back to the 

kitchen.

Thank you, Jimmie.

Okay first thing, you two.

Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 

Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 

domesticated house. That would lead 

me to believe that in the garage or 

under the sink, you got a bunch of 

cleansers and cleaners and shit like 

that, am I correct?

Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

Good. What I need you two fellas to 

do is take those cleaning products 

and clean the inside of the car. And 

I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 

need to go in the backseat, scoop up 

all those little pieces of brain and 

skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 

down the upholstery now when it 

comes to upholstery, it don't need 

to be spic and span, you don't need 

to eat off it. Give it a good once 

over. What you need to take care of 

are the really messy parts. The pools 

of blood that have collected, you 

gotta soak that shit up.  But the 

windows are a different story.  Them 

you really clean. Get the Windex, do 

a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 

raid your linen closet. I need 

blankets, I need comforters, I need 

quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 

the better, the darker the better. 

No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 

camouflage the interior of the car. 

We're gonna line the front seat and 

the backseat and the floor boards 

with quilts and blankets. If a cop 

stops us and starts stickin' his big 

snout in the car, the subterfuge 

won't last. But at a glance, the car 

will appear to be normal.  Jimmie 

lead the way, boys get to work.

A "please" would be nice.

Come again?

I said a "please" would be nice.

Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 

here to say "please."I'm here to 

tell you want to do. And if self

preservation is an instinct you 

possess, you better fuckin' do it 

and do it quick. I'm here to help.

If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 

luck gentlemen.

It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 

help is definitely appreciated.

I don't mean any disrespect. I just 

don't like people barkin' orders at 

me.

If I'm curt with you, it's because 

time is a factor. I think fast, I 

talk fast, and I need you guys to 

act fast if you want to get out of 

this. So pretty please, with sugar 

on top, clean the fuckin' car.

It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

White.

Nothin', except for the mess inside.

About twenty minutes.

Nobody who'll be missed.

You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.

How we comin', Jimmie?

Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 

somethin'

 Winston, Jimmie please, Winston.

You gotta understand something, 

Winston. I want to help you guys out 

and all, but that's my best linen. 

It was a wedding present from my 

Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 

they ain't with us anymore

 let me ask you a question, if you 

don't mind?

Sure.

Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 

millionaires?

No.

Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 

I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 

Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 

would've furnished you with a whole 

bedroom set, which your Uncle 

Marsellus is more than happy to do.

I like oak myself, that's what's in 

my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 

you an oak man?

Oak's nice.

I will never forgive your ass for 

this shit. This is some fuckedup 

repugnant shit!

Did you ever hear the philosophy 

that once a man admits he's wrong, 

he's immediately forgiven for all 

wrongdoings?

Man, get outta my face with that 

shit! The motherfucker who said that 

never had to pick up ittybitty pieces 

of skull with his fingers on account 

of your dumb ass.

I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 

threshold for the abuse I'll take. 

And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 

car and you got me in the red. Redline 

7000, that's where you are. Just 

know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 

drivin' a race car when it's in the 

red. It could blow.

You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 

mushroomcloud-layin' motherfucker!  

Every time my fingers touch brain 

I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 

OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 

usta talk about. In fact, what the 

fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 

the motherfucker should be on brain 

detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 

windows and you're pickin' up this 

nigger's skull.

Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 

of this yet.

I can't believe that's the same car.

Well, let's not start suckin' each 

other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 

is complete, clean the car, which 

moves us right along to phase two, 

clean you two.

Strip.

All the way?

To your bare ass.

Quickly gentlemen, we got about 

fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better

half comes pulling into the driveway.

This morning air is some chilly shit.

Are you sure this is absolutely 

necessary?

You know what you two look like?

What?

Like a couple of guys who just blew 

off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 

off those bloody rags is absolutely 

necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 

garbage bag.

Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 

like puttin' that out in front of 

your house for Elmo the garbage man 

to take away.

Don't worry, we're takin' it with 

us. Jim, the soap.

Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 

County before, I'm sure. Here it 

comes.

Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

Better you than me, gentlemen.

Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 

it around.

Towel 'em.

You're dry enough, give 'em their 

clothes.

Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 

planned this better. You guys look 

like... what do they look like, 

Jimmie?

Dorks. They look like a couple of 

dorks.

Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 

motherfucker.

I guess you just gotta know how to 

wear them.

Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 

on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 

jokin' our way into prison. Don't 

make me beg.

Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 

the road straight. We're going to a 

place called Monster Joe's Truck and 

Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 

Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  

The place is North Hollywood, so a 

few twist and turns aside, we'll be 

goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 

drive the tainted car. Jules, you 

ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 

in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 

path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 

does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 

something.

What did I say?

Don't do shit unless

 unless what?

Unless you do it first.

Spoken like a true prodigy.

How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 

keep your spurs from jingling and 

jangling?

I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 

off, I dunno how.

Fair enough.

I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 

up. If I get my car back any different 

than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 

be disposing of two bodies.

We cool?

Like it never happened.

Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 

this will be hers.

Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 

SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 

I'd be great.  What's with the 

outfits. You guys going to a 

volleyball game?

I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 

Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 

do you live?

Redondo Beach.

Inglewood.

It's your future: I see... a cab 

ride.

Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.

Say goodbye, Raquel.

Goodbye, Raquel.

I'll see you two around, and stay 

outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Mr. Wolf.

I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

Call me Winston.

You hear that, young lady? Respect. 

You could lean a lot from those two 

fine specimens. Respect for one's 

elders shows character.

I have character.

Just because you are a character 

doesn't mean you have character.

Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 

funny.

Wanna share a cab?

You know I could go for some 

breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 

with me?

Sure.

Thanks a bunch.

Want a sausage?

Naw, I don't eat pork.

Are you Jewish?

I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 

on swine.

Why not?

They're filthy animals. I don't eat 

filthy animals.

Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 

good.

A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 

pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 

it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 

motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 

shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 

wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 

enough sense to disregard its own 

feces.

How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 

feces.

I don't eat dog either.

Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 

a filthy animal?

I wouldn't go so far as to call a 

dog filthy, but they're definitely 

dirty. But a dog's got personality. 

And personality goes a long way.

So by that rationale, if a pig had a 

better personality, he's cease to be 

a filthy animal?

We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 

motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 

have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

Good for you. Lighten up a little. 

You been sittin' there all quiet.

I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

About what?

The miracle we witnessed.

The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 

a freak occurrence.

Do you know that a miracle is?

An act of God.

What's an act of God?

I guess it's when God makes the 

impossible possible. And I'm sorry 

Jules, but I don't think what happened 

this morning qualifies.

Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 

matter. You're judging this thing 

the wrong way. It's not about what. 

It could be God stopped the bullets, 

he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 

my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 

shit like this based on merit. Whether 

or not what we experienced was an 

accordingto-Hoyle miracle is 

insignificant. What is significant 

is I felt God's touch, God got 

involved.

But why?

That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 

don't know why. But I can't go back 

to sleep.

So you're serious, you're really 

gonna quit?

The life, most definitely.

Garcon! Coffee!

So if you're quitting the life, 

what'll you do?

That's what I've been sitting here 

contemplating. First, I'm gonna 

deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 

basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

What do you mean, walk the earth?

You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 

Just walk from town to town, meet 

people, get in adventures.

How long do you intend to walk the 

earth?

Until God puts me where he want me 

to be.

What if he never does?

If it takes forever, I'll wait 

forever.

So you decided to be a bum?

I'll just be Jules, Vincent no 

more, no less.

No Jules, you're gonna be like those 

pieces of shit out there who beg for 

change. They walk around like a bunch 

of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 

garbage bins, they eat what I throw 

away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 

a word for 'em, they're called bums. 

And without a job, residence, or 

legal tender, that's what you're 

gonna be a fuckin' bum!

Look my friend, this is just where 

me and you differ

 what happened was peculiar no 

doubt about it but it wasn't water 

into wine.

All shapes and sizes, Vince.

Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

If you find my answers frightening, 

Vincent, you should cease askin' 

scary questions.

I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 

I'll execute every one of you 

motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Customers stay seated, waitresses on 

the floor.

Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 

do it or fucking die!

You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 

here!  Asta luego!

On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 

comprende?

I'm the manager here, there's no 

problem, no problem at all

You're gonna give me a problem?

What? You said you're gonna give me 

a problem?

No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 

any problem!

I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 

like the hero type to me!

Don't take any chances. Execute him!

Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 

just a coffee shop manager. Take 

anything you want.

Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 

be all over.

Everybody just be calm and cooperate 

with them and this will be all over 

soon!

Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 

on the ground.

Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 

and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 

just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

In the bag.

What's in that?

My boss' dirty laundry.

You boss makes you do his laundry?

When he wants it clean.

Sounds like a shit job.

Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 

thing.

Open it up.

'Fraid I can't do that.

I didn't hear you.

Yes, you did.

What's goin' on?

Looks like we got a vigilante in our 

midst.

Shoot 'em in the face!

I don't mean to shatter your ego, 

but this ain't the first time I've 

had gun pointed at me.

You don't open up that case, it's 

gonna be the last.

Quit causing problems, you'll get us 

all killed! Give 'em what you got 

and get 'em out of here.

Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 

man, this ain't any of your goddamn 

business!

I'm countin' to three, and if your 

hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 

unload right in your fuckin' face. 

Clear? One...

...two... three.

You win.

It's all yours, Ringo.

Open it.

What is it? What is it?

Is that what I think it is?

It's beautiful.

Goddammit, what is it?

Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 

your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 

I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 

gonna fuckin' die bad!

Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 

bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

Chill out, honey!

Let him go!

Tell her it's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna be okay.

Promise her.

I promise.

Tell her to chill.

Just chill out.

What's her name?

Yolanda.

So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 

do anything stupid, are we?

Don't you hurt him.

Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 

gonna be like three Fonzies. And 

what' Fonzie like?

C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

He's cool?

Correctamundo! And that's what we're 

gonna be, we're gonna be cool.

Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 

and I want you to let go your gun 

and lay your palms flat on the table. 

But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

One... two... three.

Okay, now let him go!

Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 

cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 

me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 

get scared. And when motherfuckers 

get scared, that's when motherfuckers 

get accidentally shot.

Just know: you hurt him, you die.

That seems to be the situation. Now 

I don't want that and you don't want 

that and Ringo here don't want that. 

So let's see what we can do.

Now this is the situation. Normally 

both of your asses would be dead as 

fuckin' fried chicken. But you 

happened to pull this shit while I'm 

in a transitional period. I don't 

wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 

But I'm afraid I can't give you the 

case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 

I went through too much shit this 

morning on account of this case to 

just hand it over to your ass.

What the fuck's goin' on here?

It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 

do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 

cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 

still just talkin'.

Tell her we're still cool.

It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 

cool.

What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 

to just hang back and don't do shit 

unless it's absolutely necessary.

Check.

Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

Just hang in there, baby, you're 

doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 

and so am I.  It's almost over.

Now I want you to go in that bag and 

find my wallet.

Which one is it?

It's the one that says Bad 

Motherfucker on it.

That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 

it up and take out the cash. How 

much is there?

About fifteen hundred dollars.

Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 

Now with the rest of them wallets 

and the register, that makes this a 

pretty successful little score.

Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 

hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 

general principle.

You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 

now hang back and shut the fuck up. 

Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 

I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 

Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

What?

Your life. I'm givin' you that money 

so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 

read the Bible?

Not regularly.

There's a passage I got memorized. 

Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

righteous man is beset on all sides 

by the inequities of the selfish and 

the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 

he who, in the name of charity and 

good will, shepherds the weak through 

the valley of the darkness. For he 

is truly his brother's keeper and 

the finder of lost children. And I 

will strike down upon thee with great 

vengeance and furious anger those 

who attempt to poison and destroy my 

brothers. And you will know I am the 

Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 

you." I been sayin' that shit for 

years.  And if you ever heard it, it 

meant your ass. I never really 

questioned what it meant. I thought 

it was just a coldblooded thing to 

say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 

a cap in his ass. But I saw some 

shit this mornin' made me think twice. 

Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 

the evil man. And I'm the righteous 

man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 

shepherd protecting my righteous ass 

in the valley of darkness. Or is 

could by you're the righteous man 

and I'm the shepherd and it's the 

world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 

like that. But that shit ain't the 

truth. The truth is you're the weak. 

And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 

I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 

be a shepherd.

It's cold.

I think we oughta leave now.

That's probably a good idea.
